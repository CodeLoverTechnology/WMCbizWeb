                            A trademark is a symbol, design, word, or phrase that identifies one business’ goods or services from those of another. A company may come up with a design that is unique, to stand as a symbol of the company, or a product. Trademark is a kind of intellectual property.
                            To register a trademark, a trademark application must be filed by the applicant with the relevant Trade Mark Registrar in the prescribed format. Once a trademark application is filed, the Trade Marks Registrar shall process the application. If any concerns are noted on the trademark application, the Examiner would mark the application as Formalities Check Pass or Fail and if the Examiner marks the application as Formalities Fail and request for rectification of the trademark application. Then we need to submit the reply as requested by Examiner. If there are no concerns, the Trademark Examiner could also allow for the trademark application to be advertised before registration or raise an objection for registration.
                            If the Trademark Examiner finds the rectification sufficient and addresses all the concerns raised by him/her, application is allowed to be processed and marked for examination by a Trademark Examiner for preparing Trademark Examination Report.
