                            A trust is a convenient method whereby a limited number of persons may hold property on behalf of other persons, who may be a large or fluctuating body or who may include persons not yet born. Once the property has been vested in the trustees, they own the property, but they are compelled by law to exercise their ownership for the benefits of the beneficiaries and for them only. It means that legal ownership vests in the trustee or trustees but beneficiaries have de facto ownership.
